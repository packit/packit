Packit is a CLI tool that helps developers auto-package upstream projects
into Fedora operating system.

You can use packit to continuously build your upstream project in Fedora.

With packit you can create SRPMs, open pull requests in dist-git, submit koji builds and even create bodhi updates, effectively replacing the whole Fedora packaging workflow.
