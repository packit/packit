# Pack It! [![Build Status](https://ci.centos.org/job/packit-master/badge/icon)](https://ci.centos.org/job/packit-master)

This project provides tooling and automation to integrate upstream open source
projects into Fedora operating system.


## Plan and current status

We are working on two things now:
 1. Packit as a tool - a standalone CLI tool which you can install from Fedora
    repositories and use easily.
 2. Packit service - A service offering built on top of packit tool. Our
    expectation is that you would add packit service into your Github
    repository and it would start handling things automatically: opening pull
    requests on dist-git, building packages, creating updates, ...

For the run-down of the planned work, please see the task-list below.


* [ ] E2E workflow for getting upstream releases into Fedora using packit CLI.
  * [x] Bring new upstream releases into Fedora rawhide as dist-git pull
        requests. (`propose-update` command included in in 0.1.0 release)
  * [x] Build the change once it's merged. #137
  * [ ] Send new downstream changes back to upstream. (so the spec files are in
        sync) #145
  * [x] Packit can create bodhi updates. #139
  * [x] Ability to propose updates also to stable releases of Fedora.
  * [ ] Create SRPMs from the upstream repository
  * [ ] Build RPMs in COPR and integrate the results into Github.
* [ ] source-git
  * [ ] Packit can create a SRPM from a source-git repo.
  * [ ] You can release to rawhide from source-git using packit.
  * [ ] Packit can create a source-git repository.
  * [ ] Packit helps developers with their source-git repositories.
* [ ] Packit as a service
  * [ ] Packit reacts to Github webhooks.
  * [ ] Have a github app for packit.
  * [ ] Packit service is deployed and usable by anyone.


## Workflows covered by packit

This list contains workflows covered by packit tool and links to the documentation.

* [Update Fedora dist-git with an upstream release.](/docs/propose_update.md)
* [Build content of a Fedora dist-git branch in koji.](/docs/build.md)
* [Create a bodhi update.](/docs/create_bodhi_update.md)
* [Create a SRPM from the current content in the upstream repository.](/docs/srpm.md)
* [Sync content of the Fedora dist-git repo into the upstream repository.](/docs/sync-from-downstream.md)


## Configuration

Configuration file for packit is described in a separate document: [docs/configuration.md](/docs/configuration.md).

TL;DR

```yaml
specfile_path: packit.spec
synced_files:
  - packit.spec
upstream_project_name: packit
downstream_package_name: packit
```


## Requirements

Packit is written in python 3 and is supported only on 3.6 and later.

When packit interacts with dist-git, it uses `fedpkg`, we suggest installing it:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y fedpkg
```

## Installation

On Fedora:

```
$ dnf install --enablerepo=updates-testing packit
```

Or

```
$ pip3 install --user packitos
```

(packit project on PyPI is NOT this packit project)

You can also install packit from master branch, if you are brave enough:

```
$ pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/packit-service/packit.git
```


### Run from git directly:

You don't need need to install packit to try it out. You can run it directly
from git (if you have all the dependencies installed):

```
$ python3 -m packit.cli.packit_base --help
Usage: packit_base.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  -d, --debug
  -h, --help         Show this message and exit.
...
```
