This is the Debian GNU prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU hello
utility.  This package provides the classic greeting to the users of
Debian, as well as providing Debian's developers with an example of
how to package a GNU program. GNU `hello' was written by Mike Haertel,
David MacKenzie, Jan Brittenson, Charles Hannum, Roland McGrath, Noah
Friedman, Karl Eichwalder, and The King.

This package was first put together by Ian Jackson and it's currently
maintained by Santiago Vila. The source for this release was taken
from:

http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.10.tar.gz

The changes were very minimal:

- Adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
