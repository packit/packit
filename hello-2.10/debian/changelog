hello (2.10-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser fields to debian/control. Closes: #893083.

  - Add help2man to Build-Depends, for a build using git.
  * Use secure URI in Homepage field.
  * Set upstream metadata fields Bug-Submit, Name and Repository-Browse.
  * Add upstream signing-key.
  * Use a common debian/watch file which is valid for most GNU packages.
  * Sort control fields using wrap-and-sort.
  * Update standards version to 4.6.2.

    when the packages were renamed.

hello-debhelper (2.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Increase debhelper compatibility level to 9.
  * Dropped CFLAGS stuff, debhelper already takes care of that.

    if there is a Makefile. Added override_dh_auto_clean to dh version.
  * Dropped patch 01-no-usr-share-info-dir-gz. No longer needed
    when using debhelper >= 9.20120311 with a source package created

  * Updated Build-Depends accordingly.

  * Standards-Version: 3.8.2 (no changes for this).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon, 03 Aug 2009 23:39:04 +0200

hello-debhelper (2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Run "make distclean" only if Makefile exists, but do not ignore errors.
  * Use debhelper compatibility level 7, as that's the level newly
    created packages are supposed to use.

hello-debhelper (2.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed dh_testroot call, as it's not debian/rules job.

hello-debhelper (2.1.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed dh_testdir from debian/rules, as it is not very useful.
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.2 (no changes for this).
  * Updated config.guess and config.sub.
  * Use debhelper compatibility level 5, as that's the level newly
    created packages are supposed to use.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Jul 2006 19:57:10 +0200

hello-debhelper (2.1.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated config.guess and config.sub for GNU/K*BSD.

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 2004 16:45:52 +0100

hello-debhelper (2.1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Ockham's Razor" release.
  * Modified Makefile.in to make sure that install-info is never called
    during the build. This is a workaroud for an automake bug which makes
    packages to contain /usr/share/info/dir.gz.
  * Removed misleading comment at the top of debian/rules, this one is
    a complete rewrite, not a modification, from the hello debian/rules.
  * Removed debian/rules commented out calls to dh_* tools. Some of them
    (like dh_suidregister) were deprecated, others (like dh_dirsizes)
    do not even exist now. Use dh_make (from the dh-make package) if you
    want a debian/rules full of comments.
  * Removed build-arch and build-indep targets, there was a circular
    dependency between them and the build target and IMHO this should not be
    a full tutorial on writing debian/rules but a simple example instead.
  * Removed install-arch and install-indep targets, for the same reason.
  * Made install target to depend on the build target, as it should be.
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.1 (no changes required for this).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Oct 2003 13:42:20 +0200

hello-debhelper (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. GNU hello now says `Hello, world!' in a lot of
    different languages, using gettext. See the NEWS file for details.
  * Fixed spelling error in extended description (Closes: #124734).
  * The upstream source now contains install-sh (Closes: #59162).
  * The info file is now installed under the "Development" section.
  * It already has a description, so --description isn't used anymore.
  * Removed deprecated emacs stuff from the Debian changelog.
  * Removed debian/hello.1, since there is now an upstream manpage.
  * Downgraded priority to extra, since it conflicts with hello which
    is optional. In fact, this package is only useful to be apt-get sourced.
  * Standards-Version: 3.5.7:
  - Added support for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
    (dh_strip already cares about nostrip).
  - Removed #DEBHELPER# from prerm and postinst since it was only useful
    for the doc symlinks, which we don't want to manage anymore.
  - Build-Depends: debhelper.
  * New maintainer (thanks, Adam).

 -- Santiago Vila <sanvila@debian.org>  Sat, 12 Oct 2002 21:11:12 +0200

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Jan 2000 17:25:54 -0600

hello-debhelper (1.3-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added build depends.
  * Added #DEBHELPER# to postinst and prerm(blush).

    are created.

    experience by comparing the normal and enhanced way of doing
    things.
  * This version parallels hello 1.3-14.3.

 -- Adam Heath <doogie@debian.org>  Sun,  4 Oct 1998 03:18:23 -0500

hello (1.3-14.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Yet another non-maintainer release
  * Removed source and diff targets (#14601). I'm not removing the comment
    (which would fix #14602) as it's harmless and slightly interesting IMO.
  * Fixed calling of make install; I ignored this bug last time as I didn't
    understand it. Having realised what it meant, I agree that it needed
    changing (#4967)

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Sun, 16 Nov 1997 18:11:03 +0000
