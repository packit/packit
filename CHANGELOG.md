# 0.1.0

The first official release of packit!


## Features

* `packit propose-update` brings a new upstream release into Fedora rawhide.
  For more info, please [check out the documentation](/docs/update.md).

* `packit watch-releases` listens to github events for new upstream releases.
  If an upstream project uses packit, it would bring the upstream release into
  Fedora, the same way as `packit propose-update`. Please make sure that your
  upstream project is set up using
  [github2fedmsg](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/github2fedmsg/).
