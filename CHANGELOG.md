# 0.84.0

- We have adjusted how we include the resolved bugzillas in the commit messages created when syncing the release downstream so that the resolved bugzillas are included in changelog when using %autochangelog. (#2126)
- Packit now properly cleans up the branch after syncing the release which should prevent unwanted files (e.g.tarballs) being committed in dist-git. (#2125)
- Packit no longer accepts `packit.json` or `.packit.json` as a configuration file name. (#2123)
- Packit now updates ACL of a dist-git fork when creating dist-git PRs to allow users and groups with commit rights to the original dist-git repo to push directly to a source branch. (#2112)
- We have fixed an issue that prevented you from running the jobs on the GitLab.com due to failing resolution of the upstream/downstream relationship for the cloned project. (#2120)
- We have fixed an issue that you could encounter when running the Packit from the CLI that caused misinterpretation of the repository to be an upstream repo instead of a downstream. (#2117)

# 0.83.0

- We have fixed an issue that prevented automated allowlisting in the Packit Service. (#2113)
- Packit now also detects resolved bugs in the default update notes (created from changelog diff) and assigns these when submitting the Bodhi updates. (#2111)
- Packit now exports `PACKIT_UPSTREAM_PACKAGE_NAME`, `PACKIT_DOWNSTREAM_PACKAGE_NAME` and `PACKIT_CONFIG_PACKAGE_NAME` also in the `changelog_entry` action. (#2103)

# 0.82.0

- You can now specify bugs resolved by an update by `-b` or `--resolve-bug` option for `propose-downstream` and `pull-from-upstream` commands. The values will be added by default to the changelog and commit message and provided in `commit-message` and `changelog-entry` actions as `PACKIT_RESOLVED_BUGS` env variable. (#2094)

# 0.81.0

- Packit now supports the `pkg_tool` option in the config (at the top-level or with specific packages when using the monorepo syntax). This option can be used for switching between `fedpkg` or `centpkg`. (#2085)
- When updating the `Version` tag during `propose_downstream` or `pull_from_upstream`, Packit now tries to update referenced macros (if any) rather than overwriting the references. (#2087)
- If you have concerns about Packit uploading new archives to lookaside cache before creating a pull request, you can newly set `upload_sources` to False to disable this. (#2086)
- We have fixed a bug that could cause duplicit PRs to be created when using the `commit-message` action. (#2080)
- Packit now supports `commit-message` action that can be used to override the default commit message produced by Packit during `propose-downstream` or `pull-from-upstream`. Please pay attention to our [documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/actions#commit-message) with regards to the usage of this action. (#2070)

# 0.80.0

- Packit CLI now provides a new command `pull-from-upstream`, offering the same functionality as `propose-downstream` but suited for usage from the dist-git repository with Packit configuration placed there. This was primarily added to help reproduce the behaviour of the service's [pull_from_upstream job](https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/downstream/pull_from_upstream). (#2063)
- Packit now exposes `PACKIT_PACKAGE_NAME`, `PACKIT_UPSTREAM_PACKAGE_NAME` and `PACKIT_DOWNSTREAM_PACKAGE_NAME` environment variables to all actions. (#2061)
- We have fixed a bug in `packit source-git init` caused by changed behaviour in a newer version of rpmbuild. (#2048)

# 0.79.1

- We have fixed a bug in getting allowed GPG keys when syncing the release for projects with Packit config
  in monorepo format in dist-git. (#2037)

# 0.79.0

- 2 new configuration options for filtering when getting latest upstream release tag were introduced: `upstream_tag_include` and `upstream_tag_exclude`. They should contain a Python regex that can be used as an argument in `re.match`. (#2030)

# 0.78.2

- Packit's license in RPM specfile is now confirmed to be SPDX compatible. (#2026)
- `source-git init --ignore-missing-autosetup` help was improved to be less confusing. (#2016) (#2017)

# 0.78.1

- Temporarily disabled test dependencies on Fedora Rawhide because of missing `python3-deepdiff`. (#2008)

# 0.78.0

- Packit now correctly reloads upstream specfile after running `pre-sync` action. (#2006)

# 0.77.0

- Packit now includes dist-git branch in the title of the PRs for `propose-downstream` and `pull-from-upstream`. (#1996)
- We have fixed an issue with `files_to_sync` filters not being applied properly. (#1977)

# 0.76.0

- Unsuccessful Image Builder requests now provide error details so you can fix the Image configuration. (#1981)
- Copr projects created by Packit will not follow the Fedora branching from now on.
  This decision has been made to lower the load on Copr from the temporary Copr projects created, mainly, for the PR builds.
  If you are releasing your packages to Copr, please use the new setting `follow_fedora_branching`.
  Already existing projects are not affected by this change and it is also not enforced with the custom Copr repositories. (#1970)

# 0.75.0

- Detection of `%autorelease` usage in dist-git spec file during `propose-downstream` and `pull-from-upstream` has been improved and Packit will always preserve it. (#1949)
- Changed build tool to hatchling and moved metadata to `pyproject.toml`. (PEP621) (#1913)
- Respect `upstream_ref` for tags that start with "a", "b", "c", "e", "n", "r", "s". This was caused by an issue with a `branches` prefix being treated as a set of letters to remove. (#1943)
- Reset `Release` field in dist-git spec file to `1` when the version in upstream spec file is not up-to-date with the release that triggered `propose_downstream`. (#1940)
- Correctly catch the logs, if any of the user actions fail during the propose-downstream. (#1939)
- `packit source-git` related commands can skip dist-git repos, where the git trailer is not found, when looking for the right dist-git dir where to work. (#1938)
- More monorepo related fixes. (#1946, #1947, #1948)

# 0.74.0

- Allow configuring tmt tests with fmf root outside of git root (#1936)
- Removed adding the "Signed-off-by" tag to commits created by Packit. (#1934)
- Packit's source_git functionality installs/loads the `_packitpatch` script in a more reliable manner that doesn't rely on deprecated setuptools functionality. (#1926)

# 0.73.0

- Packit now supports monorepo configuration in CLI (#1864)

# 0.72.0

- Packit now preserves `%autorelease` during `propose_downstream` and `pull_from_upstream`. (#1904)

# 0.71.0

- `upstream_tag_template` is now also used when looking for the latest version tag in Git. This allows upstream repositories to mix different tag-patterns in the same repository, but consider only one to tell the latest version. (#1891)

# 0.70.0

- Now packit uses the `get_current_version` action defined by the user to retrieve version before updating the specfile %setup macro (if any). (#1886)

# 0.69.0

- 'packit validate-config' now correctly checks glob-patterns in 'files_to_sync'. (#1865)
- Aliases logic was updated to account for the upcoming Fedora release (Bodhi now marks such release as `frozen`). (#1863)
- Command `packit validate-config` now provides details about errors when it cannot parse the config file. (#1861)
- Packit does fewer API calls when searching for the package configuration file in remote repositories. (#1846)
- `--update-release`/`--no-update-release` now affects only `Release`, not `Version`. (#1857)
- Packit now provides `PACKIT_PROJECT_VERSION` environment variable when running `changelog-entry` action. (#1853)

# 0.68.0

- Packit now requires bodhi in version 7.0.0 at minimum. (#1844)
- You can now use `--srpm` option with the `packit build locally` CLI command. (#1810)

# 0.67.0

- Packit now sanitizes changelog messages in order not to break spec file parsing. (#1841)

# 0.66.0

- When configuring Copr chroot (target in Packit terminology) specific configuration, make sure to specify `additional_modules` as a string containing module names separated with a comma, example: "httpd:2.4,python:4". (#1826)
- Target-specific configuration for Copr builds can now be defined and Packit will set it for the appropriate Copr chroots. (#1822)
- You can now specify `update_release: false` in the configuration to tell Packit not to change the `Version` and `Release` in the spec file. It works the same as `--no-update-release` (renamed from now deprecated `--no-bump`) in the CLI. (#1827)
- Packit now supports setting `module_hotfixes` for Copr projects. (#1829)
- All Copr projects created by Packit now default to `enable_net=False`. Our documentation stated this but it wasn't the case. This is now corrected. (#1825)

# 0.65.2

- No changes. This is a fixup release for sake of Packit deployment.

# 0.65.1

- Packit now puts the correct release number into the changelog when the `Release` tag is reset during `propose-downstream`. (#1816)

# 0.65.0

- Packit now correctly handles a race condition when it tries to create bodhi updates for builds that are not yet tagged properly. CLI exprience was also improved for this case. (#1803)
- Packit now resets the `Release` tag during `propose-downstream` if the version is updated and the `Release` tag has not explicitly been overridden in the upstream specfile. (#1801)

# 0.64.0

- `packit propose-downstream` now uploads all remote sources (those specified as URLs) and the source specified by `spec_source_id` (whether remote or not) to lookaside. Previously, only Source0 was uploaded.

Source0 is no longer treated specially, but as `spec_source_id` is `Source0` by default, Source0 is still being uploaded by default unless `spec_source_id` is overriden. (#1778)

# 0.63.1

- Packit now correctly finds SRPM when rpmbuild reports warnings when it parses the spec file. (#1772)
- When packit.yaml is present in the repo but is empty, Packit now produces a better error message instead of an internal Python exception. (#1769)

# 0.63.0

- Fixed an issue due to which the repository was never searched for a specfile if 'specfile_path' was not specified, and 'specfile_path' was always set to '<repo_name>.spec'. (#1758)
- Packit is now able to generate automatic Bodhi update notes including a changelog diff since the latest stable build of a package. (#1747)

# 0.62.0

- Fixed an issue with version and release being updated even if `--no-bump` flag was specified. Also fixed an issue when `None` appeared in release instead of a number. (#1753)

# 0.61.0

- Packit can now correctly authenticate with Bodhi 6 and therefore create Bodhi updates. 🚀 (#1746)
- Packit now requires Python 3.9 or later. (#1745)

# 0.60.0

- Propose downstream job now pushes changes even when it's not creating a new pull request. This allows updating already existing pull requests. (#1725)

# 0.59.1

- 'packit propose-downstream' is now more informative when sources cannot be downloaded. (#1698)

# 0.59.0

- Packit CLI can now submit VM images in Red Hat Image Builder.
  All build-related commands have now consistent `--wait`/`--no-wait` options. (#1666)
- No more annoying issues will be created after a successfull propose downstream. (#1693)

# 0.58.0

- Action `fix_spec_file` can change a spec file - Packit now preserves that change. (#1679)
- Packit now uses (py)rpkg instead of rebasehelper to parse `sources` files in dist-git repos and to interact with lookaside cache. (#1680)
- `prepare-sources` command now has a new `--no-create-symlinks` option (together with the opposite `--create-symlinks`), which enables copying the archive instead of symlinking. (#1682)

# 0.57.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: fixed an issue where the repo was searched for the specfile before checking if 'downstream_package_name' is set, and '<downstream_package_name>.spec' can be used as the 'specfile_path'. (#1663)

# 0.56.0

- Packit can now build RPMs in mock. For more information see https://packit.dev/docs/cli/build/mock (#1662)
- Packit now provides a more helpful error message when it hits a known issue while creating a Bodhi update: fedora-infra/bodhi#4660 (#1660)
- Packit now correctly supports `tmt_plan` and `tf_post_install_script` in the configuration. (#1659)
- RPM build commands of Packit CLI have been merged into one build subcommand, for more information see the updated documentation at https://packit.dev/docs/cli/build/. We have also introduced a new `--srpm` option to the new build subcommand that can be used to trigger local, Copr or Koji build from an already built SRPM rather than the one implicitly created by Packit. (#1611)

# 0.55.0

- Packit can now correctly create bodhi updates using the new Bodhi 6 client. (#1651)

# 0.54.0

- Packit Bash completion file is no longer needlessly executable. (#1634)
- Transition to Bodhi's new authentication mechanism is now fully complete. (#1635)

# 0.53.0

- Packit now works with Bodhi 5 and Bodhi 6 authentication mechanism. (#1629)
- Git ref name that Packit works with during `propose-downstream` is now made more obvious in logs. (#1626)
- Packit now correctly handles creation of custom archives in root while a specfile is in a subdirectory. (#1622)
- Creation of a Bodhi update will not timeout anymore as Packit is now using a more efficient way of obtaining the latest build in a release. (#1612)

# 0.52.1

- Fixed a regression where string values for the 'targets' and 'dist_git_branches' configuration keys were not accepted. (#1608)

# 0.52.0

- Packit will not raise exceptions anymore when creating an SRPM with dangling symlinks. (#1592)
- `packit validate-config` now checks the paths in the package config (path of the specfile,
  paths of the files to be synced) relative to the project path (#1596)
- The name of the temporary branch in `_packitpatch` was normalized which fixed applying the patches during `packit source-git init` (#1593)

# 0.51.0

- We have decided to deprecate `metadata` section for job configurations. All
  metadata-specific configuration values can be placed on the same level as the job
  definition. For now we are in a backward-compatible period, please move your settings
  from the `metadata` section. (#1569)
- Packit now correctly removes patches during `packit source-git init` when the
  preamble does not contain blank lines. (#1582)
- `packit source-git` commands learnt to replace Git-trailers in commit
  messages if they already exist. (#1577)
- Packit now supports `--release-suffix` parameter in all of the related CLI
  commands. Also we have added a support for the `release_suffix` option from
  configuration to the CLI. With regards to that we have introduced a new CLI
  switch `--default-release-suffix` that allows you to override the configuration
  option to Packit-generated default option that ensures correct NVR ordering
  of the RPMs. (#1586)

# 0.50.0

- When initializing source-git repos, the author of downstream commits created from patch files which are not in a git-am format is set to the original author of the patch-file in dist-git, instead of using the locally configured Git author. (#1575)
- Packit now supports `release_suffix` configuration option that allows you to override the long release string provided by Packit that is used to ensure correct ordering and uniqueness of RPMs built in Copr. (#1568)
- From the security perspective, we have to decided to disable the `create_pr` option for our service, from now on Packit will unconditionally create PRs when running `propose-downstream`.
  We have also updated the `propose-downstream` CLI such that it is possible to use `create_pr` from configuration or override it via `--pr`/`--no-pr` options. (#1563)
- The `source-git update-*` commands now check whether the target repository is pristine and in case not raise an error. (#1562)

# 0.49.0

- A new configuration option `downstream_branch_name` has been added,
  which is meant to be used in source-git projects and allow users
  to customize the name of the branch in dist-git which corresponds
  to the current source-git branch. (#1555)
- Introduced two new build and test target aliases: `fedora-latest-stable`
  resolves to the latest stable Fedora Linux release, while `fedora-branched`
  resolves to all branched releases (all Fedora Linux release, except `rawhide`). (#1546)
- When using `post_upstream_clone` to generate your spec-file,
  Packit now correctly checkouts the release before the action is run. (#1542)

# 0.48.0

- `packit source-git update-dist-git` and `packit source-git update-source-git` now check the synchronization of source-git and dist-git repositories prior to doing the update. If the update can't be done, for example, because the histories have diverged, the command provides instructions on how to synchronize the repositories. A `--force` option is available to try to update the destination repository anyway.
- Downstream synchronization of the Packit configuration file (aka `packit.yaml`) should be fixed. (#1532)
- Packit will no longer error out when trying to create a new Copr repository when it is already present (caused by a race condition). (#1527)
- Interactions with Bodhi should be now more reliable when creating Bodhi updates. (#1528)

# 0.47.1

- When using Packit CLI for creating Bodhi updates, you can now set `fas_username` and `fas_password`
  in your Packit user config to not be asked about that when the command is executed. (#1517)

# 0.47.0

- When specfile is being generated, and both `specfile_path` and
  `downstream_package_name` are not set, Packit now correctly resolves this
  situation and sets `specfile_path` to the name of the upstream repo suffixed
  with ".spec". (#1499)
- We are now building SRPMs for Packit's own PRs in Copr. For more info see #1490 and
  https://packit.dev/docs/configuration/#srpm_build_deps (#1490)
- All source-git-commands were updated to append a `From-source-git-commit` or `From-dist-git-commit`
  Git-trailer to the commit messages they create in dist-git or source-git, in order to
  save the hash of the commits from which these commits were created. This information
  is going to be used to tell whether a source-git repository is in sync with the
  corresponding dist-git repository. (#1488)
- Spec file and configuration file are no more automatically added to the list of files
  to sync when the `new files_to_sync` option is used. The old `synced_files` option is
  deprecated. (#1483)
- We have added a new configuration option for Copr builds `enable_net` that allows you to
  disable network access during Copr builds. It is also complemented by
  `--enable-net/--disable-net` CLI options if you use Packit locally. (#1504)

# 0.46.0

- Synchronization of default files can now be disabled using a new config
  `files_to_sync`. Key `sync_files` is now deprecated. (#1483)
- Packit now correctly handles colons in git trailer values in source-git commits. (#1478)
- Fedora 36 was added to the static list of `fedora-` aliases. (#1480)

# 0.45.0

- A new `packit source-git update-source-git` command has been introduced for
  taking new changes from dist-git (specified by a revision range) to source-git.
  These may include any changes except source code, patches and `Version` tag
  changes in the spec file. ([packit#1456](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1456))
- There's a new configuration option `create_sync_note` that allows you to
  disable creating of README by packit in downstream. ([packit#1465](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1465))
- A new option `--no-require-autosetup` for `source-git init` command has been
  introduced. Please note that source-git repositories not using `%autosetup` may
  not be properly initialized. ([packit#1470](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1470))

# 0.44.0

- Packit now correctly finds the release, even if you don't use the version as
  the title of the release on GitHub.
  ([packit#1437](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1437))
- Local branches are now named as `pr/{pr_id}` when checking out a PR, even
  when it's not being merged with the target branch. This results in the NVR
  of the build containing `pr{pr_id}` instead of `pr.changes{pr_id}`.
  ([packit#1445](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1445))
- A bug which caused ignoring the `--no-bump` and `--release-suffix` options
  when creating an SRPMs from source-git repositories has been fixed. Packit
  also doesn't touch the `Release` field in the specfile unless it needs to be
  changed (the macros are not expanded that way when not necessary).
  ([packit#1452](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1452))
- When checking if directories hold a Git-tree, Packit now also allows `.git`
  to be a file with a `gitdir` reference, not only a directory.
  ([packit#1458](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1458))

# 0.43.0

- A new `packit prepare-sources` command has been implemented for preparing
  sources for an SRPM build using the content of an upstream repository.
  ([packit#1424](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1424))
- Packit now visibly informs about an ongoing cloning process to remove
  potential confusion.
  ([packit#1431](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1431))
- The `upstream_package_name` config option is now checked for illegal
  characters and an error is thrown if it contains them.
  ([packit#1434](https://github.com/packit/packit/pull/1434))

# 0.42.0

- Running `post-upstream-clone` action in `propose-downstream` command was fixed.
  This solves the issue for projects that generate the specfile during this action.
- New config option `env` has been added for specifying environment variables
  used for running tests in the Testing Farm.

# 0.41.0

- Packit now supports `changelog-entry` action that is used when creating
  SRPM. The action is supposed to generate whole changelog entry (including
  the `-` at the start of the lines) and has a priority over any other way we
  modify the changelog with. (#1367)
- Fixed an issue, which raised an `UnicodeEncodingError`, when working with
  dist-git patch files with an encoding other than UTF-8. (#1406)
- Backup alias definitions now reflect the official release of Fedora Linux 35. (#1405)
- We have introduced a new configuration option `merge_pr_in_ci` that allows
  you to disable merging of PR into the base branch before creating SRPM in
  service. (#1395)
- Fixed an issue, where spec-files located in a sub-directory of upstream
  projects, were not placed in the root of the dist-git repo when proposing
  changes downstream. (#1402)

# 0.40.0

- Packit will deduce the version for SRPM from the spec file, if there are no git tags or action for acquiring current version defined. (#1388)
- We have introduced new options for generating SRPM packages: (#1396)
  - `--no-bump` that prevents changing of the release in the SRPM, which can be used for creating SRPMs on checked out tags/releases.
  - `--release-suffix` that allows you to customize the suffix after the release number, e.g. reference bugzilla or specific branch of the build.
- Deprecated configuration options `current_version_command` and `create_tarball_command` have been removed and are no longer supported. They are superseded by actions `get-current-version` and `create-archive`. (#1397)

# 0.39.0

- Bug in Packit causing issues with local build when the branch was named with prefix rpm has been fixed. (#1380)
- We have added a new option to Packit CLI when creating Bodhi updates, you can use `-b` or `--resolve-bugzillas` and specify IDs (separated by comma, e.g. `-b 1` or `-b 1,2,3`) of bugzillas that are being closed by the update. (#1383)

# 0.38.0

- `packit validate-config` was updated to check if files to be synced
  downstream are present in the upstream repo and emit a warning in case they
  are missing. (#1366)
- Patch files are read as byte streams now, in order to support having
  non-UTF-8 characters. (#1372)

# 0.37.0

- `packit source-git` init was updated to try to apply patches with `git am` first, and use `patch` only when this fails, in order to keep the commit message of Git-formatted (mbox) patch files in the source-git history. (#1358)
- Packit now provides `PACKIT_RPMSPEC_RELEASE` environment variable in actions. (#1363)

# 0.36.0

- `status` command has been refactored and now provides much cleaner output. (#1329)
- A log warning is raised if the specfile specified by the user in the config doesn't exist. (#1342)
- Packit by default locally merges checked out pull requests into target branch. Logging for checking out pull requests was improved to contain hashes and summaries of last commit on both source and target branches. (#1344)
- `source-git update-dist-git` now supports using Git trailers to define patch metadata, which will control how patches are generated and added to the spec-file. `source-git init` uses this format to capture patch metadata when setting up a source-git repo, instead of the YAML one. To maintain backwards compatibility, the YAML format is still parsed, but only if none of the patches defines metadata using Git trailers. (#1336)
- Fixed a bug that caused purging or syncing upstream changelog (when not configured) from specfile when running `propose-downstream`. New behavior preserves downstream changelog and in case there are either no entries or no %changelog section present, it is created with a new entry. (#1349)

# 0.35.0

- Propose-downstream: log when a PR already exists downstream (#1322).
- `packit init` to set spec file path in the config if it's not defined (#1313).
- Make it possible to clone packages from staging dist-git (#1306).
- Source-git: squash patches by patch name - no need to have a dedicated attribute, `squash_commits`, for that (#1309).
- Source-git: look for the config file in .distro/source-git.yaml as well (#1302).
- Source-git: change logging from error to warning when %prep is not using %(auto)setup (#1317).

# 0.34.0

- Source-git: `source-git init` was refactored, which also changed and simplified the CLI.

# 0.33.1

- Source-git: Updated the source-git format produced by `source-git init` (#1277)
- Source-git: drop support of packages not using %autosetup
- Source-git: Use --force when staging the .distro dir
- Source-git init: Do not download remote sources
- Source-git init: Raise an error if the dist-git repo is not pristine

# 0.32.0

- Command `packit generate` was removed. It has been deprecated for a while
  in favour of `packit init`. (#1269)
- Packit now explicitly requires git and rpm-build. (#1276)
- Source-git: Patch handling is more consistent. (#1263)
- Source-git: Passing changelog from source-git repo to dist-git was fixed. (#1265)
- Source-git: There is a new `source-git` subcommand, that groups source-git related
  commands `init` and `update-dist-git`. (#1273)

# 0.31.0

- Downstream package name is set when dist-git path is provided. (#1246)
- A bug with older Python present on Fedora Linux 32 and EPEL 8 is fixed. (#1240)
- There is a new `update-dist-git` subcommand that is
  an improved offline version of `propose-downstream`. (#1228)
- Source-git: Commit metadata newly includes `patch_id`. (#1252)

# 0.30.1

- Fixed a bug caused by new click release. (#1238)

- Fixed test error caused by missing git configuration #794

# 0.10.1

A patch release, which fixes/improves some job metadata fields:

- Packit now sets description and instructions for newly created COPR projects.
- There is a new config option to set ID of a spec file Source which packit
  should operate on (defaults to 0). Packit now also updates the `%[auto]setup`
  macro in `%prep` so that the generated archive is correctly unpacked - this
  behavior matches what tito does.
- There is a new action `fix-spec` which by default sets Source0, %version and
  %setup macros in spec file - you can override it with your own
  implementation. [Documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/actions)
- Packit now sets certain environment variables during `fix-spec` and
  `create-archive` actions. You can read more about this in the documentation
  for actions.

  command.
- There is a new command `copr-build` which enables you to submit builds into
  Fedora COPR build system.

# 0.4.1

- Patch release with few fixes/minor changes.

We have a brand new website: https://packit.dev/!
[packit.dev repo](https://github.com/packit-service/packit.dev) contains source content for [Hugo website engine](https://gohugo.io).

## Features

- Packit supports [Source-git](https://packit.dev/source-git/).

# 0.2.0

## Breaking Changes

- We have renamed two variables in our configuration file:
  - `package_name` → `downstream_package_name`
  - `upstream_name` → `upstream_project_name`

## Features

- You can now use packit to sync files from your dist-git repo into upstream
  (mainly to keep spec files in sync). `sync-from-downstream` is the command.
- An SRPM can be created out of the current content in your upstream repository
  — please check out the `srpm` command.
- Packit is able to create bodhi updates using the `create-update` command.
- You can ask packit to build the latest content of your dist-git
  repository in koji: the command is `build`.
- We have added `--force-new-sources` option to propose-update update command
  to bypass our caching optimization.
- `propose-update` command now has option `--local-content` which disables
  checking out the tag with the upstream release. This is useful if you forget
  to bump your spec file when doing a release.
- You are now able to pick a specific upstream release version in
  `propose-update` command.

## Fixes

- Packit checks if the upstream tarball is already present in the lookaside
  cache so it's not uploaded twice. We have fixed a behavior when the upload
  part was skipped while having old tarball specified in dist-git. Packit now
  does the right thing - checks if sources file has the correct tarball
  referenced.
- We have updated several error messages which were coming from GitPython and
  it was not clear what's wrong.

## Minor

- We have added CONTRIBUTING.md to ease contribution to packit. All your
  patches are welcome!
- We are now using black, flake8 and mypy to improve code quality.
- We have moved some info from README to dedicated doc. Also, all the
  documentation should be up to date.

# 0.1.0

The first official release of packit!

## Features

- `packit propose-update` brings a new upstream release into Fedora rawhide.
  For more info, please [check out the documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/cli/propose-update/).

- `packit watch-releases` listens to github events for new upstream releases.
  If an upstream project uses packit, it would bring the upstream release into
  Fedora, the same way as `packit propose-update`. Please make sure that your
  upstream project is set up using
  [github2fedmsg](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/github2fedmsg/).
