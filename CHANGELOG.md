# 0.37.0

- `packit source-git` init was updated to try to apply patches with `git am` first, and use `patch` only when this fails, in order to keep the commit message of Git-formatted (mbox) patch files in the source-git history. (#1358)
- Packit now provides `PACKIT_RPMSPEC_RELEASE` environment variable in actions. (#1363)

# 0.36.0

- `status` command has been refactored and now provides much cleaner output. (#1329)
- A log warning is raised if the specfile specified by the user in the config doesn't exist. (#1342)
- Packit by default locally merges checked out pull requests into target branch. Logging for checking out pull requests was improved to contain hashes and summaries of last commit on both source and target branches. (#1344)
- `source-git update-dist-git` now supports using Git trailers to define patch metadata, which will control how patches are generated and added to the spec-file. `source-git init` uses this format to capture patch metadata when setting up a source-git repo, instead of the YAML one. To maintain backwards compatibility, the YAML format is still parsed, but only if none of the patches defines metadata using Git trailers. (#1336)
- Fixed a bug that caused purging or syncing upstream changelog (when not configured) from specfile when running `propose-downstream`. New behavior preserves downstream changelog and in case there are either no entries or no %changelog section present, it is created with a new entry. (#1349)

- Packit now explicitly requires git and rpm-build. (#1276)
- Source-git: Patch handling is more consistent. (#1263)
- Source-git: Passing changelog from source-git repo to dist-git was fixed. (#1265)
- Source-git: There is a new `source-git` subcommand, that groups source-git related
  commands `init` and `update-dist-git`. (#1273)

# 0.24.0

- No user-facing changes done in this release.

# 0.23.0

- The `propose-update` has been renamed to `propose-downstream`; `propose-update` is now deprecated
  to unify the naming between CLI and service. ([@jpopelka](https://github.com/jpopelka), [#1065](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/1065))
- Our README has been cleaned and simplified. ([@ChainYo](https://github.com/ChainYo), [#1058](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/1058))
- The :champagne: comment with the installation instructions has been disabled by default. ([@mfocko](https://github.com/mfocko), [#1057](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/pull/1057))

## Minor changes and fixes

- Fixed test error caused by missing git configuration #794

# 0.10.1

- We don't touch `Version` in spec files and change `Release` only by default.

## Minor changes and fixes

- Improved documentation (README & CONTRIBUTING).

- Packit now sets description and instructions for newly created COPR projects.
- There is a new config option to set ID of a spec file Source which packit
  should operate on (defaults to 0). Packit now also updates the `%[auto]setup`
  macro in `%prep` so that the generated archive is correctly unpacked - this
  behavior matches what tito does.
- There is a new action `fix-spec` which by default sets Source0, %version and
  %setup macros in spec file - you can override it with your own
  implementation. [Documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/actions)
- Packit now sets certain environment variables during `fix-spec` and
  `create-archive` actions. You can read more about this in the documentation
  for actions.

## Fixes

  skipped and rest of the information is printed.
- Packit is able to handle URLs to git repo if they end with a slash.

# 0.5.1

## Breaking changes

- Command `version` no longer exists and is now replaced with a `--version`
  option. (thanks to @FrNecas)

## Fixes

- Fix creation of SRPMs - they can be rebuilt now properly.

  command.
- There is a new command `copr-build` which enables you to submit builds into
  Fedora COPR build system.

- Packit now supports the most popular archive formats, not just .tar.gz
  (thanks to @FrNecas for contributing this feature)

# 0.2.0

## Breaking Changes

- We have renamed two variables in our configuration file:
  - `package_name` → `downstream_package_name`
  - `upstream_name` → `upstream_project_name`

## Features

- You can now use packit to sync files from your dist-git repo into upstream
  (mainly to keep spec files in sync). `sync-from-downstream` is the command.
- An SRPM can be created out of the current content in your upstream repository
  — please check out the `srpm` command.
- Packit is able to create bodhi updates using the `create-update` command.
- You can ask packit to build the latest content of your dist-git
  repository in koji: the command is `build`.
- We have added `--force-new-sources` option to propose-update update command
  to bypass our caching optimization.
- `propose-update` command now has option `--local-content` which disables
  checking out the tag with the upstream release. This is useful if you forget
  to bump your spec file when doing a release.
- You are now able to pick a specific upstream release version in
  `propose-update` command.

## Fixes

- Packit checks if the upstream tarball is already present in the lookaside
  cache so it's not uploaded twice. We have fixed a behavior when the upload
  part was skipped while having old tarball specified in dist-git. Packit now
  does the right thing - checks if sources file has the correct tarball
  referenced.
- We have updated several error messages which were coming from GitPython and
  it was not clear what's wrong.

## Minor

- We have added CONTRIBUTING.md to ease contribution to packit. All your
  patches are welcome!
- We are now using black, flake8 and mypy to improve code quality.
- We have moved some info from README to dedicated doc. Also, all the
  documentation should be up to date.

# 0.1.0

The first official release of packit!

## Features

- `packit propose-update` brings a new upstream release into Fedora rawhide.
  For more info, please [check out the documentation](https://packit.dev/docs/cli/propose-update/).

- `packit watch-releases` listens to github events for new upstream releases.
  If an upstream project uses packit, it would bring the upstream release into
  Fedora, the same way as `packit propose-update`. Please make sure that your
  upstream project is set up using
  [github2fedmsg](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/github2fedmsg/).
