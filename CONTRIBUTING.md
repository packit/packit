# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `packit`.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to `packit`.
Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## Reporting Bugs
Before creating bug reports, please check a [list of known issues](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues) to see
if the problem has already been reported (or fixed in a master branch).

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/new).
Be sure to include a **descriptive title and a clear description**. Ideally, please provide:
 * version of packit you are using (`rpm -q packit` or `pip3 freeze | grep packitos`)
 * the command you executed and a debug output (using option `--debug`)

If possible, add a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.
You can also comment on the closed issue to indicate that upstream should provide a new release with a fix.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues.
When you are creating an enhancement issue, **use a clear and descriptive title** and **provide a clear description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.

## Guidelines for Developers

If you would like to contribute code to the `packit` project, this section is for you!

### Is this your first contribution?

Please take a few minutes to read GitHub's guide on [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).
It's a quick read, and it's a great way to introduce yourself to how things work behind the scenes in open-source projects.

### Dependencies

If you are introducing a new dependency, please make sure it's added to:
 * [setup.cfg](setup.cfg)

### Documentation

If you want to update documentation, find corresponding file in [docs](/docs) folder.

#### Changelog

When you are contributing to changelog, please follow these suggestions:

* The changelog is meant to be read by everyone. Imagine that an average user
  will read it and should understand the changes.
* Every line should be a complete sentence. Either tell what is the change that
  the tool is doing or describe it precisely:
  * Bad: `Use search method in label regex`
  * Good: `Packit now uses search method when...`
* And finally, with the changelogs we are essentially selling our projects:
  think about a situation that you met someone at a conference and you are
  trying to convince the person to use the project and that the changelog
  should help with that.

### Testing

Tests are stored in [tests](/tests) directory.
We use [Tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox) with configuration in [tox.ini](tox.ini).

Running tests locally:
```
make prepare-check && make check
```

As a CI we use [CentOS CI](https://ci.centos.org/job/packit-pr/) with a configuration in [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile).


#### Storing HTTP communication offline

OGR enables you to store complete HTTP requests offline. We can then use those
cached HTTP communication during testing.

In order to use this feature, you have to set `github_requests_log_path` on
`Config`. You can then use `get_github_service` from `ogr_services` to get
GithubService which has everything set up:

1. If `github_token` is set, all the HTTP requests will be stored in the file
2. If the token is not set, offline http requests will be used instead of
   talking to live GitHub API.


### Makefile

#### Requirements

- ansible

#### Targets
Run [recipe-tests.yaml](recipe-tests.yaml) ansible playbook to install packages needed to run tests:
```
make prepare-check
```

Run tests locally:
```
make check
```

### Additional configuration for development purposes

#### Copr build

For cases you'd like to trigger copr build in your copr project, you can configure it in
packit configuration of your chosen package:
```
jobs:
- job: copr_build
  trigger: pull_request
  metadata:
    targets:
      - some_targets
    # (Optional) Defaults to 'packit'
    owner: <your_fedora_username>
    # (Optional) Defaults to <github_namespace>-<github_repo>
    project: some_project_name
```

### How to contribute code to packit

1. Create a fork of the `packit` repository.
2. Create a new branch just for the bug/feature you are working on.
3. Once you have completed your work, create a Pull Request, ensuring that it meets the requirements listed below.

### Requirements for Pull Requests

* Please create Pull Requests against the `master` branch.
* Please make sure that your code complies with [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
* One line should not contain more than 100 characters.
* Make sure that new code is covered by a test case (new or existing one).
* We don't like [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code).
* The tests have to pass.

### Checkers/linters/formatters & pre-commit

To make sure our code is compliant with the above requirements, we use:
* [black code formatter](https://github.com/ambv/black)
* [Flake8 code linter](http://flake8.pycqa.org)
* [mypy static type checker](http://mypy-lang.org)

There's a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) config file in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml).
To [utilize pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#usage), install pre-commit with `pip3 install pre-commit` and then either
* `pre-commit install` - to install pre-commit into your [git hooks](https://githooks.com). pre-commit will from now on run all the checkers/linters/formatters on every commit. If you later want to commit without running it, just run `git commit` with `-n/--no-verify`.
* Or if you want to manually run all the checkers/linters/formatters, run `pre-commit run --all-files`.

Thank you for your interest!
packit team.
